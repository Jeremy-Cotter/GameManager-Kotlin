There are many different Desktop Applications that allow you to manage different aspects of the game youâ€™re playing. However, sometimes you want multiple functions from those applications, but you need to use two plus. This multi-tool will allow you to have those multiple functions all in one app for quick switching. The user will be able to roll dice of different sizes and quantity, count the life of one of more people, create a turn order for the game. These are the starting feature the user will have in order to make their tabletop gameplay simple, compact, and easy.

Features:

    Compact and Orderly user interface
    Roll dice of different sizes and quantity (ex. 1 dice 6 sides, 3 dice 20 side)
    Count the life of one of more people( Quanties of both 1 and 5)
    Turn order for the game (ex. (Max, Joe, Eric, Jeremy) in either a randomized or set order
